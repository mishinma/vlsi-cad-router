# A Maze Router
An algorithm to route the wires in integrated circuits. The router handles 2 point nets, non-unit costs in the routing grid, bend penalties and uses 2 separate routing layers. This was a programming assignment for the course "VLSI CAD: Logic to Layout" by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on Coursera.
